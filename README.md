## About this project
Chiaru is a free app designed and developed by a single developer in highschool. 
I made this app because I often found maximizing my studying frustrating - switching back and forth between different apps and resources. So, I developed an app where it can all sit in one place.

## Feedback
If you find bugs or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me.
